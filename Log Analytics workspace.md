#monitoring 

Where we stream logs from different sources in order to generate alerts.

We can create an action group which can be attached to multiple alerts.
An **action group** in Azure is a collection of notification preferences and actions that are triggered when an alert rule is fired. It defines who or what should be notified when an alert condition is met. Each action group can have multiple actions, such as sending an email, SMS, or triggering a webhook.

Workspaces aren't limited in their storage space and can grow to petabytes of data. There's no need to split workspaces due to scale.
