**Practice exams:**
1. https://www.udemy.com/share/10b9Ee3@_Ihp4QzQ4aeIgBFncakRRxg4z5h_qbyUH7BNbrjkjonEkd6wC4eWv389RyVhBGvEWA==/  --> (Very bad formatting; hard to read and understand as there are no spaces)

2. https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/az-305/view/14/  --> You can view 70 questions for free, out of 286 in total. Exactly formatted as in the exam, very clear and quick, with screenshots and immediate answer checking. 
   If we had full access, in my opinion this would be enough to prepare for the whole exam.
