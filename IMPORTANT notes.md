- Not all Azure services automatically replicate data or automatically fall back from a failed region to cross-replicate to another enabled **region**. In these scenarios, recovery and replication must be configured by the customer. #regions #replication #failed-region
-  An Azure subscription links to an Azure account, which is an identity in Microsoft Entra ID or in a directory that Microsoft Entra ID trusts. An account can have multiple subscriptions, but it’s only required to have one.
- Management groups facts:
	1. 10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory.
	2. A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth. This limit doesn't include the root level or the subscription level.
	3. Each management group and subscription can support only one parent.

- ## What are containers?

	Containers are a virtualization environment. Much like running multiple virtual machines on a single physical host, you can run multiple containers on a single physical or virtual host. ***(DOCKER)***
