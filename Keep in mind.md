| Identity Management                | a broader term that encompasses various identity management features within Azure AD, including user and group management                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Privileged Identity Management** | allows you to manage, control, and monitor access within Azure AD. It provides capabilities for **assigning temporary or just-in-time privileged roles**, including the ability to grant users elevated access for a **specific period** or for specific tasks.                                          |
| **Conditional Access Policies**    | used to enforce access controls based on conditions such as ***user location*** or ***device state***. **Multi-Factor-Authentication**                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Managed Identity**               | used for **authenticating** applications and services to Azure resources **without needing credentials in the code**                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Shared Access Signatures (SAS)** | provides a way to grant **limited access** to Azure Storage resources without exposing your account keys. You can specify the permissions (e.g., read, write) and the ***time duration for which the SAS token is valid*** (ideal for scenarios where you need to provide temporary access to resources) |
